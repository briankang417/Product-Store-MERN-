This product store project uses the MERN stack to create a [product website](https://product-store-mern-kit5.onrender.com/) where users can list products. 
Currently, properties of products include: name, price, and image. 

To add a product, users can tap on the "+" icon in the top right corner. This will take users to the create page where users can add their own product.
Products are stored in MongoDB as a NoSQL collection. I chose NoSql to store products and users (which I am working on implementing in the future).

The website also supports changing between light and dark modes. Users can adjust to dark mode by tapping on the moon icon and to light mode by tapping on the sun icon.
